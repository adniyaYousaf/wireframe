            <p class="article__summary">Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
                Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
                When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
                You select the modified files you want to Stage
                The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
                Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
                You can revert back to any previous commit.
                Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!</p>
